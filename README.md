# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets â€” classifying them as either **positive** or **negative**. It uses the **Sentiment140** dataset containing 1.6 million tweets and applies a **Logistic Regression** model for Classification and then prediction.

##  Project Overview

- **Objective**: Automatically classify the sentiment of tweets using text processing and machine learning.
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Dataset**: [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) (from Kaggle)

##  Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
      
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removal of noise (usernames, URLs, punctuation)
   - Lowercasing
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal 
   - Stemming ('PorterStemmer')
   
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Used `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text into numerical feature vectors

4. **Model Training**
   - Used `train_test_split` to divide the data into training and test sets
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier on the preprocessed text features

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy calculation using `accuracy_score`
   - Potential for future extension with precision, recall, F1-score
